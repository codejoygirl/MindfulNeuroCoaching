                                            can tell you the real me is a lot easier to live with! As I set out on

                                            because of her story. I have grown so much in such a short time
                                            with her. Her heart is huge and her ability to help me understand
                                            the reason I was struggling with my past trauma was spot on.
                                            Her gentle, supportive, and direct manner made it safe to explore
                                            things I did not want to question or think about. Her honesty
                                            and delivery are refreshing, I felt heard and understood. I broke
                                            through so many years of internal strife in just weeks with
                                            Grace. Today, I am pursuing my dream of speaking that I never
                                            had the confidence to pursue before meeting Grace. I highly
